# Project 4: Reinforcement Learning
## Train a Smartcab How to Drive

A smartcab is a self-driving car from the not-so-distant future that ferries people from one arbitrary location to another. In this project, you will use reinforcement learning to train a smartcab how to drive.

### Environment

Your smartcab operates in an idealized grid-like city, with roads going North-South and East-West. Other vehicles may be present on the roads, but no pedestrians. There is a traffic light at each intersection that can be in one of two states: North-South open or East-West open.

US right-of-way rules apply: On a green light, you can turn left only if there is no oncoming traffic at the intersection coming straight. On a red light, you can turn right if there is no oncoming traffic turning left or traffic from the left going straight.

To understand how to correctly yield to oncoming traffic when turning left, you may refer to this official drivers’ education video, or this passionate exposition.

### Inputs

Assume that a higher-level planner assigns a route to the smartcab, splitting it into waypoints at each intersection. And time in this world is quantized. At any instant, the smartcab is at some intersection. Therefore, the next waypoint is always either one block straight ahead, one block left, one block right, one block back or exactly there (reached the destination).

The smartcab only has an egocentric view of the intersection it is currently at (sorry, no accurate GPS, no global location). It is able to sense whether the traffic light is green for its direction of movement (heading), and whether there is a car at the intersection on each of the incoming roadways (and which direction they are trying to go).

In addition to this, each trip has an associated timer that counts down every time step. If the timer is at 0 and the destination has not been reached, the trip is over, and a new one may start.

### Outputs

At any instant, the smartcab can either stay put at the current intersection, move one block forward, one block left, or one block right (no backward movement).

### Rewards

The smartcab gets a reward for each successfully completed trip. A trip is considered “successfully completed” if the passenger is dropped off at the desired destination (some intersection) within a pre-specified time bound (computed with a route plan).

It also gets a smaller reward for each correct move executed at an intersection. It gets a small penalty for an incorrect move, and a larger penalty for violating traffic rules and/or causing an accident.

### Goal

Design the AI driving agent for the smartcab. It should receive the above-mentioned inputs at each time step t, and generate an output move. Based on the rewards and penalties it gets, the agent should learn an optimal policy for driving on city roads, obeying traffic rules correctly, and trying to reach the destination within a goal time.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** with the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
) library installed

### Code

Template code is provided in the `smartcab/agent.py` python file. Additional supporting python code can be found in `smartcab/enviroment.py`, `smartcab/planner.py`, and `smartcab/simulator.py`. Supporting images for the graphical user interface can be found in the `images` folder. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality for the `LearningAgent` class in `agent.py` when requested to successfully complete the project. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `smartcab/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```python smartcab/agent.py```  
```python -m smartcab.agent```

This will run the `agent.py` file and execute your agent code.
