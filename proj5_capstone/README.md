In this capstone project, you will leverage what you’ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. You will first define the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions and performance metrics. Next, you will analyze the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it.
You will then implement your algorithms and metrics of choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and postprocessing steps along the way. Afterwards, you will collect results about the performance of the models used, visualize significant quantities, and validate/justify these values. Finally, you will construct conclusions about your results, and discuss whether your implementation adequately solves the problem.
Suggested application areas include:
- Deep Learning
- Robot Motion Planning
- Healthcare
- Education
- Computer Vision
- Investment and Trading

### Capstone Project Highlights

This project is designed to prepare you for delivering a polished, end-to-end solution report of a real-world problem in a field of interest. When developing new technology, or deriving adaptations of previous technology, properly documenting your process is critical for both validating and replicating your results.

Things you will learn by completing this project:

- How to research and investigate a real-world problem of interest.
- How to accurately apply specific machine learning algorithms and techniques.
- How to properly analyze and visualize your data and results for validity.
- How to document and write a report of your work.

Software and Libraries

Your project must be written in Python 2.7. Given the free-form nature of this capstone project, the software and libraries you will need to successfully complete your work will vary depending on the chosen application area and problem definition. Because of this, it is imperative all necessary software and libraries used in your capstone project are accessible to the reviewer. An included README file which documents the software used, Python libraries (including version), and extraneous installation information is sufficient.

Deliverables

The following files should be included in your submission, and can be packaged as a single zip file for convenience:

A 9 - 15 page report in PDF addressing the five major project development phases.
All development code necessary for your solution in a clean, commented format.
Any required supporting files for your code (.csv datasets, input files, etc.).
If these files are too large, please instead reference appropriate download links in the README.
A README documenting the software and libraries used in your project, including any necessary instructions required to execute your code.
